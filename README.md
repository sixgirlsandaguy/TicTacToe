* When the deploy branch was pushed to the master branch, installation for Jacoco followed.
* When we started working on Heroku, we misunderstood the instruction from a TA and thought that it could only work to push commits straight to the origin master. We had done a lot of commits in the Herko master when we figured out that we should have made a seperate branch for Heruko, and were therefore forced to push all of our commits straight to the origin master. After having figured this out, we started pushing the Heroku commits to the right branch, WebUI. Because of this, the master includes a lot of Heroku commits that all should have been in the master.
