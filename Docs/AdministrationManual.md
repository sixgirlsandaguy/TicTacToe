#Administration manual

This manual is considered to be a guide for new users that are going to have access to the project.

#Program
The user needs to have access to the following:

**GitHub:** The program is stored in the source control system Github.</br>
**Shell:** The user needs to have a SSH client installed on his computer. (For example terminal for mac and putty for windows).</br>
**Git:** Git needs to be set up on the shell. [Further information here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git "a Safari extension"). </br>
**Java:** [A java version](https://java.com/en/download/ "java") 1.8 or newer is required. </br>

Because the program has continuous delivery the administrator has nothing to do with new versions of the program. 

##The following command should be run in a SSH client in order to get the program up and running:
* in shell: git clone https://github.com/sixgirlsandaguy/TicTacToe.git
* in shell: gradle run
* put this URL in a browser that is installed in your computer: http://localhost:4567
